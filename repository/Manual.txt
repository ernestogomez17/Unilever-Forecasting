1. Data Preparation:

	I. data_cleaning_npz_nix: Unilever Dataset Preparation

		> Input: This file takes two "npz" files, one for timestamp and other for data. Input files are available and can be changed in 2nd cell.

		> Output: A compatible csv file for our StemGNN implementations.

	II. data_preparation: Walmart Dataset Preparation

		> Input: This file takes two "csv" files, one for timestamp and other for data. Input files are available and can be changed in 2nd and 3rd cell.

		> Output: Four compatible csv file for our StemGNN implementations. Two of them are daily and the other 2 are weekly. In each subgroup one is filtered and the other one contains all data with no elimination. The number of eliminated consecutive zeros can be changed in 6th cell.

2. Implementation:

	III. SG_nix_implementation_tuning: Hyperparameter Tuning

		> Input: A file that was derived from "Data Preparation" step. It can be changed from 2nd cell.

		> Output: A csv file contains metrics for each hyperparameters setting sorted from best to worst. In 5th cell hyperparameter values can be set.

	IV. SG_nix_implementation_nt_pred: Prediction

		> Input: A file that was derived from "Data Preparation" step, and hyperparameter setting from "Hyperparameter Tuning" step. These can be changed from 2nd and 5th cell.

		> Output: A csv file contains predictions in required format by Unilever, and trained weights in "checkpoints" directory.

3. Auxiliary

	V. extrametrics: This file contains code snippets for "WMAPE" and "R^2".
